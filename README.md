Scientific Computing with Python Solutions
===========

This is a copy of my solutions for the freecodecamp.org Scientific Computing with Python certificate. My originals can be found here: https://replit.com/@CaraConrad

This course is a series of five projects consisting primarily of various mathematic calculation tools.
I had quite a bit of Python experience before doing this so it was relatively easy but I found it to be a fun exercise.
Descriptions of each project can be found in the README.md files included with each project.

In my opinion this is a good entry point to learning basic Python programming but would likely be very challenging for somebody with no programming experience at all.
If you're working on this certificate and looking for answers I suggest leaving and working on it on your own. You will be a much better programmer because of it!
